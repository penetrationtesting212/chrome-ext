# API Recording Not Working - Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

Run through this checklist to identify your specific issue:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Basic Setup
- [ ] Extension is loaded in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- [ ] Extension is enabled (toggle is ON)
- [ ] Extension was built recently (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Extension was reloaded after build
- [ ] Playwright is attached to a tab (not just opened)

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Check Recording Status
- [ ] Clicked "API" button in toolbar
- [ ] Clicked "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Recording" button
- [ ] Status shows "üî¥ Recording..." (not "‚ö´ Not Recording")
- [ ] No error alert appeared

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Network Activity
- [ ] Actually interacted with your app after starting recording
- [ ] App makes HTTP/HTTPS requests (not just static page loads)
- [ ] Not on chrome:// pages (must be http:// or https://)
- [ ] Waited a few seconds for requests to appear

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: "No requests captured"

**Symptoms:**
- Recording status shows "üî¥ Recording..."
- But request list stays at "(0)"
- Empty state message visible

**Possible Causes:**

#### A) Not interacting with app
```
‚ùå Started recording ‚Üí Waiting...
‚úÖ Started recording ‚Üí Click buttons, submit forms, load data
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Click "Start Recording"
2. Go to your app tab
3. Login, browse, click buttons, submit forms
4. Check extension ‚Üí Should see requests!
```

#### B) Only static content loading
```
‚ùå Static HTML page with no API calls
‚úÖ React/Angular/Vue app that fetches data
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Your app should make fetch/axios calls like:
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

// These will be captured!
```

#### C) Requests are filtered out
```
‚ùå Loading images: logo.png, style.css, fonts.woff
‚úÖ API calls: /api/users, /auth/login, /data/products
```

**Check Console:**
```javascript
// Press F12 on extension ‚Üí Console tab
// Look for: "Ignoring request: [URL]"
```

**What gets filtered:**
- Images (.png, .jpg, .gif, .svg)
- Fonts (.woff, .woff2, .ttf)
- Chrome extension URLs (chrome-extension://)
- Chrome internal URLs (chrome.google.com)

#### D) Recording wrong tab
```
‚ùå Recording Tab A, but interacting with Tab B
‚úÖ Recording Tab A, interacting with Tab A
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Make sure Playwright is attached to YOUR app's tab
2. Check console: "Using Playwright-attached tab for API recording: [ID]"
3. That tab ID should match your app's tab
```

---

### Issue #2: "Another debugger already attached"

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Failed to start recording: Another debugger is already attached to tab
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Close Chrome DevTools (F12) on your app tab
2. Reload extension (chrome://extensions/)
3. Click "Start Recording" again
```

**See:** `DEBUGGER_CONFLICT_FIX.md` for full details

---

### Issue #3: "Failed to start recording" (No tab found)

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Failed to start recording
Make sure Playwright is attached to a tab
```

**Cause:** Playwright is not attached to any tab

**Solution:**
```
1. Navigate to your application (e.g., http://localhost:5173)
2. Click Playwright extension icon
3. Wait for recorder to open
4. THEN click "API" ‚Üí "Start Recording"
```

**Verify Attachment:**
```javascript
// In extension background console:
console.log('Attached tabs:', Array.from(attachedTabIds));
// Should show: [123456]
```

---

### Issue #4: "Recording status stuck"

**Symptoms:**
- Click "Start Recording"
- Button changes but status doesn't update
- Or status shows recording but button still says "Start"

**Solution:**
```
1. Click "Stop Recording" (if visible)
2. Reload extension
3. Refresh your app page
4. Start recording again
```

---

### Issue #5: Extension not loading

**Symptoms:**
- Can't find "API" button
- Extension doesn't open
- Blank screen when clicking icon

**Solutions:**

#### A) Need to rebuild
```bash
cd examples/recorder-crx
npm run build
```

#### B) Need to reload
```
chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Find "Playwright CRX" ‚Üí Click "Reload"
```

#### C) Loaded wrong folder
```
Must load: examples/recorder-crx/dist/
NOT: examples/recorder-crx/src/
```

---

### Issue #6: Requests captured but no details

**Symptoms:**
- Requests appear in list
- But clicking shows empty details
- No request/response bodies

**Possible Causes:**

#### A) Response body too large
```
Response > 10MB ‚Üí Body not captured
```

#### B) Binary response
```
Images, PDFs ‚Üí Body shows as base64 or empty
```

#### C) Network error
```
Request failed before response ‚Üí No body
```

**Check:**
```javascript
// Click request ‚Üí Look for:
- Status code (200, 404, etc.)
- Response time
- Headers present?
- Body field empty or has data?
```

---

## Detailed Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify Extension State

**Open Extension Console:**
```
1. chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Playwright CRX"
3. Click "background page" (under Inspect views)
4. Console tab opens
```

**Check Variables:**
```javascript
// Type in console:
isApiRecording
// Should show: false (when not recording) or true (when recording)

recordingTabId
// Should show: number (e.g., 123456) when recording

Array.from(attachedTabIds)
// Should show: [123456] (tab IDs where Playwright is attached)
```

### Step 2: Test with Demo Data

**Quick Test:**
```
1. Click "API" button
2. Click "+ Demo Data" button
3. Check "Recorder" tab
4. Should see sample request instantly!
```

**If demo data works:**
‚úÖ UI is working
‚úÖ Storage is working  
‚ùå Network capture is the issue

**If demo data doesn't work:**
‚ùå Service/Storage issue
‚Üí Reload extension and try again

### Step 3: Monitor Console Logs

**What to look for:**

**Success:**
```
‚úÖ API Recording started on tab 123456
Using Playwright-attached tab for API recording: 123456
Network.requestWillBeSent: GET https://yourapp.com/api/users
Network.responseReceived: 200 OK
```

**Errors:**
```
‚ùå No valid tab found for API recording
‚ùå Another debugger is already attached
‚ùå Failed to attach debugger
```

**Warnings:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Ignoring request: chrome-extension://...
‚ö†Ô∏è Another debugger is attached. Attempting to detach and retry...
```

### Step 4: Test Network Capture

**Use Test API:**
```
1. Start recording
2. Open new tab
3. Navigate to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
4. Check extension ‚Üí Should capture the GET request!
```

**If this works:**
‚úÖ Recording works
‚ùå Your app might not be making API calls

**If this doesn't work:**
‚ùå Core issue with debugger attachment
‚Üí Check DevTools conflicts, permissions

### Step 5: Check Permissions

**In manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "debugger",     ‚Üê Required!
    "tabs",         ‚Üê Required!
    "storage"       ‚Üê Required!
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "<all_urls>"    ‚Üê Required!
  ]
}
```

**Verify:**
```
chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Playwright CRX ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Permissions
Should show:
‚úì Debugger
‚úì Read and change all your data on all websites
‚úì Tabs
```

---

## Advanced Diagnostics

### Check if debugger is actually attached

**In your app's console (F12):**
```javascript
// If you see this banner:
"Chrome is being controlled by automated test software"
‚Üí Debugger IS attached ‚úÖ

// If no banner:
‚Üí Debugger NOT attached ‚ùå
```

### Monitor debugger events

**In background console:**
```javascript
// Add temporary logging:
chrome.debugger.onEvent.addListener((source, method, params) => {
  console.log('[Debugger Event]', method, source.tabId, params);
});

// Start recording ‚Üí Should see:
// Network.requestWillBeSent
// Network.responseReceived
// Network.loadingFinished
```

### Force detach all debuggers

**Emergency reset:**
```javascript
// In background console:
chrome.tabs.query({}, tabs => {
  tabs.forEach(tab => {
    chrome.debugger.detach({ tabId: tab.id })
      .then(() => console.log('Detached from', tab.id))
      .catch(() => {});
  });
});

// Then reload extension and try again
```

## Testing Workflow

### Recommended Test Sequence:

```bash
# 1. Start backend (if using local API)
cd playwright-crx-enhanced/backend
npm run dev
# ‚Üí Backend running on http://localhost:3000

# 2. Start frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
# ‚Üí Frontend running on http://localhost:5173

# 3. Build extension
cd ../../examples/recorder-crx
npm run build
# ‚Üí Built to dist/

# 4. Load extension
# chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Load unpacked ‚Üí Select dist/

# 5. Test extension
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173
# Click Playwright icon ‚Üí Login
# Click "API" ‚Üí "Start Recording"
# Login to app, browse, etc.
