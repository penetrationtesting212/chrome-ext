# üìã Git Push Guide for Playwright-CRX with AI Self-Healing

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for pushing the AI Self-Healing enhanced Playwright-CRX code to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/tanvi124112/playwrite-plugin

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already done)
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/playwright-crx-feature-test-execution

# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/tanvi124112/playwrite-plugin.git
```

### 2. **Configure Git User** (if not already configured)
```bash
# Set your git username
git config user.name "Your Name"

# Set your git email
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. **Stage All Files**
```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .
```

### 4. **Create a Commit**
```bash
# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add AI-Powered Self-Healing Enhancement to Playwright-CRX

- Implement machine learning for locator confidence scoring
- Add pattern recognition for dynamic elements
- Create auto-healing with rollback capability
- Add visual similarity detection
- Implement historical success tracking
- Create comprehensive AI Self-Healing UI with 4 tabs
- Integrate AI service with existing self-healing
- Add real data integration for live healing statistics
- Create Red Hat deployment guide and installation script
- Add comprehensive documentation and implementation guides"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
# Push to the main branch
git push -u origin main

# Or if you're using a different branch
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

### 6. **Alternative: Create a New Branch First**
```bash
# Create a new branch for the AI Self-Healing feature
git checkout -b feature/ai-self-healing

# Add and commit files
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add AI-Powered Self-Healing Enhancement"

# Push the new branch
git push -u origin feature/ai-self-healing

# Then create a pull request on GitHub
```

3. Create a wiki page with the deployment guides
4. Consider creating GitHub Issues for feature requests or bug reports
5. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD if needed

## üìù Complete Command Summary

```bash
# Initialize repository (if needed)
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/tanvi124112/playwrite-plugin.git

# Configure user (if needed)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Stage all files
git add .

# Create commit
git commit -m "feat: Add AI-Powered Self-Healing Enhancement to Playwright-CRX"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
