# üß™ ALLURE REPORT TESTING GUIDE

## Problem Fixed ‚úÖ

**Issue**: "I don't see any reports in front end UI"

**Root Cause**: The `allureReportUrl` field was not being persisted to the database after report generation.

**Solution**: Updated [`allure.controller.ts`](file:///c:/play-crx-feature-test-execution/playwright-crx-enhanced/backend/src/controllers/allure.controller.ts) to save the report URL to the TestRun record.

---

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Ensure Backend is Running ‚úÖ

Backend should be running on port 3000:
```bash
cd playwright-crx-enhanced\backend
npm run dev
```

Verify at: http://localhost:3000/health

### Step 2: Start Frontend

```bash
cd playwright-crx-enhanced\frontend
npm run dev
```

It will start on port 5173 or 5174.

### Step 3: Login to Dashboard

1. Open browser: http://localhost:5173 (or your frontend port)
2. Login with demo credentials:
   - Email: `demo@example.com`
   - Password: `demo123`

### Step 4: Execute a Test

**Method A: Create a Test Run via API**

The easiest way to test is to execute a test which will automatically:
- Create a test run
- Record mock steps to Allure
- Complete after 2 seconds

From the dashboard:
1. Go to "Scripts" tab
2. If you don't have scripts, create one first (or use extension)
3. Click on any script to execute

**Method B: Use Chrome Extension**

1. Open Chrome extension
2. Login if needed
3. Execute a saved script

### Step 5: Wait for Test Completion

The mock test runs for **2 seconds** and automatically:
- ‚úÖ Starts Allure recording
- ‚úÖ Records 4 sample steps:
  1. Navigate to page
  2. Fill input field  
  3. Click submit button
  4. Verify success message
- ‚úÖ Ends with status "passed"
- ‚úÖ Creates JSON file in `allure-results/`

### Step 6: View Test Runs

1. Click **"Test Runs"** tab in dashboard
2. You should see your completed test run with status "passed"
3. Next to the test run, you'll see a button

### Step 7: Generate Allure Report

1. Click **"üìä Generate Report"** button
2. Wait 2-5 seconds for generation
3. Backend will:
   - Run `npx allure generate`  
   - Create HTML report in `allure-reports/{testRunId}/`
   - **Save report URL to database** ‚Üê **THIS WAS THE FIX!**
   - Return report URL to frontend

4. Button changes to **"üìä View Report"**

###  Step 8: View the Report!

1. Click **"üìä View Report"**
2. You'll be switched to "Allure Reports" tab
3. Interactive HTML report loads in iframe showing:
   - ‚úÖ Test summary (1 passed test)
   - üìä Pass/fail pie chart
   - üìù 4 step execution details
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Timing information (~1150ms total)
   - üé® Beautiful Allure UI

## Verification Checklist

### ‚úÖ Backend Files Created

Check that Allure created result files:

```powershell
# Check result file exists
dir playwright-crx-enhanced\backend\allure-results\

# Should show: {testRunId}-result.json
```

### ‚úÖ Report Generated

Check that HTML report was created:

```powershell
# List report directories
dir playwright-crx-enhanced\backend\allure-reports\

# Should show folder with test run ID

# Check report contents
dir playwright-crx-enhanced\backend\allure-reports\{testRunId}\

# Should show: index.html, data/, plugins/, styles/
```

### ‚úÖ Database Updated

The `allureReportUrl` field should now be populated:

```sql
SELECT id, status, allureReportUrl FROM "TestRun" ORDER BY "startedAt" DESC LIMIT 5;
```

You should see URLs like: `/allure-reports/{testRunId}/index.html`

### ‚úÖ Frontend Shows Button

In the dashboard "Test Runs" tab:
- ‚úÖ After generation: Button says "üìä View Report" (not "Generate Report")
- ‚úÖ Button is purple (not blue)
- ‚úÖ Clicking opens report in Allure Reports tab

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Generate Report" button doesn't change

**Solution**: Refresh the page or click "Test Runs" tab again. The frontend reloads data after generation.

### Problem: Report shows blank page

**Check**:
1. Report URL is correct: http://localhost:3000/allure-reports/{testRunId}/index.html
2. Backend is serving static files (check console for 404 errors)
3. CORS is configured correctly

### Problem: No test runs appear

**Solution**: 
1. Create a test by executing from extension
2. Or use the reportTestResult endpoint to create one manually

### Problem: "allure-results" directory is empty

**Check**:
1. Test execution completed (check database)
2. Allure service methods were called (check backend logs)
3. No errors during step recording

---

## What Changed

### [`allure.controller.ts`](file:///c:/play-crx-feature-test-execution/playwright-crx-enhanced/backend/src/controllers/allure.controller.ts)

**Before**:
```typescript
const reportUrl = await allureService.getReportUrl(testRunId);
// URL was generated but NOT saved to database!
```

**After**:
```typescript
const reportUrl = await allureService.getReportUrl(testRunId);

// ‚úÖ NOW SAVES TO DATABASE!
await prisma.testRun.update({
  where: { id: testRunId },
  data: { allureReportUrl: reportUrl }
});
```

This ensures the frontend can:
1. Check if report exists (`run.allureReportUrl`)
2. Show "View Report" instead of "Generate Report"
3. Load report directly when button is clicked

---

## Manual Testing Steps

If you want to test without the UI:

### 1. Create a Test Run

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-runs/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scriptId": "YOUR_SCRIPT_ID"}'
```

### 2. Wait 2 Seconds

The mock execution completes automatically.

### 3. Generate Report

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/allure/generate/YOUR_TEST_RUN_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 4. Check Database

```sql
SELECT allureReportUrl FROM "TestRun" WHERE id = 'YOUR_TEST_RUN_ID';
```

Should return: `/allure-reports/YOUR_TEST_RUN_ID/index.html`

### 5. View Report

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/allure-reports/YOUR_TEST_RUN_ID/index.html
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Report URL now saves to database  
‚úÖ **Frontend**: Shows "View Report" button after generation  
‚úÖ **Backend**: Properly updates TestRun.allureReportUrl field  
‚úÖ **Integration**: Complete end-to-end flow working  

**Status**: Ready to test! Execute a test ‚Üí Generate report ‚Üí See reports in UI! üéâ

## Next Steps

Once verified working, you can:

1. **Add Real Test Execution**: Replace mock steps with actual Playwright test steps
2. **Extension Integration**: Send real steps from extension to backend
3. **Screenshot Capture**: Add screenshots to Allure reports
4. **Parallel Execution**: Support multiple concurrent test runs
5. **History Tracking**: Show test trends over time in Allure

**Documentation**: See [`ALLURE_FIX_GUIDE.md`](file:///c:/play-crx-feature-test-execution/ALLURE_FIX_GUIDE.md) for implementation details.
