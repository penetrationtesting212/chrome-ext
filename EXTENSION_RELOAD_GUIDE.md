# Extension Reload & Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Backend Server** - Now Running ‚úì
- Server is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:3000/ws

### 2. **Manifest Permissions** - Updated ‚úì
- Added explicit `host_permissions` for `http://localhost:3000/*`
- This allows the extension to make fetch requests to the backend

### 3. **Allure Service** - Fixed ‚úì
- Removed problematic `InMemoryAllureWriter` dependency
- Using file-based approach instead

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you still see "Failed to fetch"

1. **Check Backend is Running**
   ```powershell
   # Test the health endpoint
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"ok"}`

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Right-click on the extension popup ‚Üí "Inspect"
   - Look for error messages in the Console tab
   - Check the Network tab for failed requests

3. **Check Extension Console**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Playwright CRX"
   - Click "service worker" or "Inspect views: background page"
   - Look for errors in the console

4. **Verify CORS is Working**
   - Backend `.env` has: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS="chrome-extension://*,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174,http://localhost:3000"`
   - This allows requests from any chrome extension

### If Backend Stops Running

```powershell
# Navigate to backend directory
cd c:\play-crx-feature-test-execution\playwright-crx-enhanced\backend

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

### If You Need to Clear Extension Storage

1. Open Chrome DevTools on the extension popup (right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. Go to **Application** tab ‚Üí **Storage** ‚Üí **Clear site data**
3. Reload the extension

## üìä What Was Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`manifest.json`**
   - Added explicit host permissions for localhost:3000
   - This fixes the "Failed to fetch" CORS issue

2. **`allure.service.ts`**
   - Removed broken `InMemoryAllureWriter` import
   - Using direct file-based Allure reporting

### Build Output:
- Extension rebuilt successfully in 24.46s
- All modules compiled without errors
- New `dist/` folder ready for loading

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

‚úÖ **Correct Flow:**
1. Click extension icon
2. See login screen with gradient background
3. Enter credentials
4. Click "Login" button
5. See recorder UI with tabs: Actions, Execute, API, etc.
6. Logout button visible in top-right

‚ùå **Previous Issue:**
- "Failed to fetch" error due to missing backend server
- CORS errors due to manifest permissions

---

## üîë Test Credentials

```
Email: demo@example.com
Password: demo123
```

This account should already exist in your database. If it doesn't, you can create it using:

```powershell
cd c:\play-crx-feature-test-execution\playwright-crx-enhanced\backend
npm run seed  # If you have a seed script
```

Or register a new account through the extension's login screen (if registration is enabled).

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome
2. **Test the login** with demo credentials
3. **Verify all features work**: recorder, API testing, execution, etc.

If you encounter any other issues, check the browser console and extension service worker console for detailed error messages.
